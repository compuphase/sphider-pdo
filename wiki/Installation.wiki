#summary A brief summary how to install Sphider-PDO.

= Acknowledgement =

This page is essentially copied from the [http://www.sphider.eu/docs.php original Sphider site]. A few steps are slightly different with Sphider-PDO, and I decided it was better to "copy & adjust" the installation instructions instead of listing only the changes.

Note, though, that these instructions only cover the basic installation. There is more documentation on the [http://www.sphider.eu/docs.php original Sphider site] (e.g. customization and explanation of various indexing options).


= Installation =

  # Unpack the files, and copy them to the server, for example to `/home/youruser/sphider`.
  # Depending on the database that you wish to use, you may need to create it first. For example, when using MySQL, create a database in MySQL to hold Sphider data.
    * at command prompt type (to log into MySQL):
      `mysql -u <your username> -p`<br>
      Enter your password when prompted.
    * in MySQL, type:
      `CREATE DATABASE sphider;`<br>
      Of course you can use some other name for database instead of sphider.
    * Use `exit` to exit MySQL.
      For more information on how to create a MySQL database and give it the necessary permissions, check [http://www.MySQL.com]
  # Edit the file `settings/database.php` and adjust/create the database connection string. Details are on the DatabaseSetup page.
  # Open `admin/install.php` in your browser, which will create the tables necessary for Sphider to operate.
  # Edit `admin/auth.php` to change the administrator user name and password (default values are 'admin' and 'admin').
  # Open `admin/admin.php` in your browser and start indexing.
  # `search.php` is the default search page. You can now test the Sphider search engine.
  # If all is well, it is recommended to delete `admin/install.php` from the server. This is because this script is not password-protected.


= Configuration =

The Sphider search engine can be customized either through the administrator interface or by editing the configuration file directly.
  * To use the administrator interface, open `admin/admin.php` in your browser.
  * To change the configuration directly, edit the file `settings/conf.php`.

Note that the administrator interface can be disabled, for changing the configuration. in the file `admin/auth.php`, you can set the definition of `CONFIGSET` to 1 to disable the administrator interface. This increases the security of the search engine (but reduces the convenience).
