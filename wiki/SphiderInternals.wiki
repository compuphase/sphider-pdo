#summary A collection of notes on how Sphider operates.

= Introduction =

This page is a "work in progress" on some of the internal operations of the Sphider search engine. These notes may clarify some to the limitations of the script.

= Character encodings =

There are various character encodings in play with each other:
  * The database stores text as Latin-1.
  * In HTML pages, special characters are encoded as HTML entities (`&eacute` for Ã©). This applies both the pages scanned by the spider and to the pages generated as "search results" by the search engine.
  * When the user types a word with an accented character in the search field, this word is passed to the search engine in UTF-8 encoding.

The Sphider script need to convert one encoding into the other. The supported character set is the lowest common denominator, meaning Latin-1 (alias ISO 8859-1). This is sufficient for Western and West European languages.
